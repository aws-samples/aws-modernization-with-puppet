## Who is Puppet?

Puppet helps enterprises modernize and manage their infrastructure with the solutions to automate anywhere, reliably scale, and integrate compliance and security across hybrid infrastructure. More than 40,000 organizations — including more than 80 percent of the Global 5000 — have benefited from Puppet’s open source and commercial solutions to ensure business continuity, optimize costs, boost compliance and ensure security, all while accelerating the adoption of DevOps practices and delivery of self-service. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Puppet is a privately held company with offices in London, Belfast, Singapore, Sydney and Timișoara.

## What is Puppet Enterprise?

It isn’t humanly possible to keep up with the constant innovation and risks that new technology brings. Automation has become a requirement, and Puppet sets the standard for delivering and managing your IT estate predictably and at scale. Our solutions automate how you continuously deliver, make compliant, remediate, and manage your multi-cloud environment. So you can focus on more important things in your life.

Puppet Enterprise enables both individuals and teams to get started with automation simply, deliver infrastructure safely, and expand automation across everything, no matter where it lives. It is the only solution that meets you where you are on your automation journey, and grows as your automation footprint grows, too.

## What is Relay by Puppet?

At the speed modern hybrid infrastructure is changing operation teams need a unified, self-service automation platform that democratizes the ability to create automation and integrates the varied tools and APIs they already use. They need this platform to implement repeatable, consistent, audited workflows, rather than build their own ad hoc scripts.

Relay facilitates this need by being providing an easy cloud workflow automation solution for cloud infrastructure. Build and share fully automated workflows in minutes instead of days. Ensure hybrid cloud environments are secure, compliant, and cost efficient. Improve operational efficiency with increased reliability, minimized hiring of specialized roles, and reduced time to recovery through automation that the whole organization can use.
