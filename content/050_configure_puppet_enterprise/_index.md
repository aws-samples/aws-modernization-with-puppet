# Configuring Puppet Enterprise

Configuring Puppet Enterprise (PE) to integrate with Relay for this workshop will leverage the same basic workflow and mechanisms you'd employ when managing resources upon arbitrary EC2 nodes hosting organization applications. We'll begin by configuring and deploying a basic [Control Repository](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.8/control_repo.html) which contains all the code required to configure PE for this workshop.
